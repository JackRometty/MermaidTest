# Process Flows

Source of truth for how things work. Each flow lives in `/Flows` as a markdown file with an embedded Mermaid diagram.

Browse by category in the sidebar, or use search.

## Adding a flow

1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate `/Flows` subfolder
2. Add front matter with `parent:` set to the category name
3. Include a title, one-line summary, and mermaid diagram
