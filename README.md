# Process Flows

Source of truth for how things work. Each flow lives in `/Flows` as a markdown file with an embedded Mermaid diagram.

## Flows

| Flow | Description | Figma |
|------|-------------|-------|
| [Insurance Verification](Flows/insurance-verification.md) | Verifies patient insurance coverage via API, with manual fallback | — |
| [Patient Equipment Order](Flows/patient-equipment-order.md) | End-to-end from inquiry through fulfillment | — |

## Adding a flow

Create a new `.md` file in `/Flows` with a title, one-line summary, and mermaid diagram. Then add a row to the table above.
